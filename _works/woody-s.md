## Introduction   

A hypothetical rebrand for Woody's Grooming products. I redesigned the logo mark and other brand visuals and created various deliverables to showcase how the new identity system would be applied to company marketing and packaging. Through this project I wanted to redesign the identity to better reach the audience of adults with a modern color palette and redesigned packaging.

## Identity   

Woody's was developed through a collaboration of celebrity barbers and stylists. They created these products for the everyday man, someone that wants a simple regimen with basic, no-frill products that smell good and get the job done. While the overall appearance and tone of Woody's is clearly targeted for men, I found it redundant to include the For Men tagline. Through this rebrand I aimed to enhance the experience of the everyday, on-the-go man.
