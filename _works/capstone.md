## Why Pixels?

Different mediums are used to accomplish different goals.

They are often much cheaper to produce, this is one of the main reasons why Pokemon didn't move on for over a decade.

Pixel art is viewed from a fixed camera angle, forcing the player to view the map how the creator intended it to be.

Even though younger generations grew up on the glossy versions of Nintendo Mario, game developers still continue to use pixel art styles today.

<style>

.glide ul {

max-width: initial;

}

.glide img {

pointer-events: none;

}

.glide__slides {

padding-left: 0;

}

.glide .glide__slide {

opacity: 1; transform: scale(1);

}

</style>

<div class="glide mt4">

<div class="glide__track" data-glide-el="track">

<ul class="glide__slides">

<li class="glide__slide" style="text-align: left;"> <img src="/assets/images/cDraft1.png" alt="first iteration">

<small>The screens were created to fit on the Gameboy Color. Screen resolution is set to 160 x 144 px.</small>

</li>

<li class="glide__slide" style="text-align: left;"> <img src="/assets/images/cDraft2.png" alt="second iteration">

<small>The cafe screen was modified a few times to maximize player freedom and movement.</small>

</li>

<li class="glide__slide" style="text-align: left;"> <img src="/assets/images/cDraft3.png" alt="second iteration">

<small>The kitchen room will appear smaller than the cafe and outdoor screen.</small>

</li>

</ul>

</div>

<small style="text-align: center; color: var(--ink-6); font-weight: 600; display: block;">drag, swipe or use arrow keys</small>

</div>
