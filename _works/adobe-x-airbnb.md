### Adobe Creative Jam + Airbnb

Adobe teamed up with Airbnb to foster design thinking, and show off new talent. They held a nation wide competition in 2020 to see how we could create new ways for friends and family to travel together and share photos when booking through Airbnb and using Adobe’s new Prototyping software, XD.

### The Solution

Comet serves the comic-reading community by establishing trust through engaging and smooth user experience, dashed with a pinch of colorful whimsy. A unique asymmetrical design and flattened navigation system help achieve this. The goal is to empower authors by helping them reach the widest audience possible by having a free to read model while allowing creators to monetize their creators through physical products like prints, books, and clothing.

### Flowchart

Simplifying the interface was a key goal in this project. To achieve this, I flattened and combined pages to reduce the use of the back button.

### Iterations

Comet went through a few rounds of designs and different directions. With each design getting tested by a group of over 20 college students to test the usability and visual look.

After Sketches a few rough ideas for the different screens. We took the best ideas and turned them in medium level fidelity mockups before coming to final designs.

This direction did not test well users. With many participants having trouble finding and navigating to features.</small> </li> <li class="glide__slide"> <img src="/assets/images/bc_phone1.png" alt="second draft"> <small>Second draft split navigation was tested better than the gesture navigation. But 32% of user-reported being confused about the spit segment control and how the bottom navigation worked. Users did respond well to the asymmetrical top image calling it modern looking.</small> </li> <li class="glide__slide"> <img src="/assets/images/bc_phone1.png" alt="third draft"> <small>A smaller iteration change that kept the layout of the last version while trying to address the navigation issue. While users were able to navigate better than the last version. The user reported the brightly color interface was distracting and took away from the art.</small> </li> </ul> </div> <small style="text-align: right; color: var(--ink-6); font-weight: 600; float: right; margin-right: 2rem;">drag, swipe or use arrow keys</small> </div>

### Branding

A strong geometrical shape with subtle page-flipping elements creates purposeful movement while calling back to the comic reader theme. A subtle gradient background allows the Comet badge to pop off the background, improving its presence on various assets like app icons and favicons. A yellow and mustard gradient was picked for its ability to draw attention with a gradient was used to give the app a more modern feel.

### Final Screens

In our usability testing, out biggest issue was the navigation. With the final design, I resolved the problem by using a standard navigation bar and improved the **visibility of button and functionalities** by giving them a solid background color and borders.

The final design also kept the asymmetrical design that was popular in the previous designs. This allows us to maximize the places to show the comic artwork by using preview links as masking elements. The rest of the graphical elements are made up of circles and blobs shapes with all corners rounded to give a playful and friendly feel.

<!-- ### What we learned

After the release, we interviewed 30+ of our BlueStacks TV users from all over the world. Based on their feedback, most people found it easy to use and it helped newer streamers enter into the game streaming community. The following is a list of suggested improvements from our users:

Customize their stream to make it look more appealing to their viewers Notify streamers when they receive a new follower More detailed stream settings Adjust mic, game, and system volume Option to select which webcam and/or microphone to use
