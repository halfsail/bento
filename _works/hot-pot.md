### Introduction

Hot Pot is a cooking app designed to make cooking easy. It helps users quickly find time sensitive recipes that fits their needs. A unique feature this app offers is the ability to search for recipes based on ingredients the user already has in their kitchen. Our target audience is users between the ages of 18 to 30, with this age range consisting mostly of college students, young adults, and parents.

### Strategy

Many people refrain from cooking due to time consumption and budgeting. Hot Pot focuses on time and efficiency, providing our users with recipes that reflect their lifestyle. Users should be able to categorize recipes based on thier current needs such as, budget, cravings, dietary needs, time and duration. Our primary focus is on efficiency, convenience and creating a user friendly interface.

### Flowchart

Creating a comprehensive flowchart helped pave the way for the development of Hot Pot. Using this as a rough guideline, we continued to the prototying phase of the project.
